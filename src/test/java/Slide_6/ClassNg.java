// These annotation help execute codes in sequence
// The sequence is Before suit/Before Test/Before Class/Before method/Test/After method/After class/After test/ Result of test/ After suit
// Codes inside Test annotation
// You can create another annotation @Test, which will have own Before/After method rught before and after
// It will be between before Class/ After class, each test own Before/After method 
// For every Testng Class, we initiliase browser(driver, Chrome, Url), execute codes, and close browser
// The initilisation browser basic (System.setProperties, driver=new Chromedriver, driver.geturl) is common to all class.
// Most of annotation  are not useful, so we keep @Before class/ @test/ @After class
// Before class with browser initilisation
// Testng class can still have static webdriver driver as global variable, and throws declaration
// @After class will close the driver, driver.close(); 
// After running, we can see in details if test passed/failed, and where it failed. Organised way
// Alerts can have own method too, on POM they belong to. 

// If running multiple @Test, we can control the flow and order of the test, add priority number next to the annotation
// Such as @Test(priority =1) and @Test (priority=2). 
// I can also control the dependency of test, for ex, if Test2 can execute only if Test1 passes, so if Test1 fails, Test2 won't run
// After writing priority, add dependsonmethods=" the name of method which is dependendent") 
// Such as @Test2(priority=2, dependsOnMethods="Test1").
// However, if there is @TestÂ£, no dependent on any other test, even though Test1 failed, and Test2 doesn't run, Test3 will run
